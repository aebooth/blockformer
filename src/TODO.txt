Fix collide() for platform now that we will have incremental
movement.

Make collisions follow these rules:
-Walls
    Player.left < Plat.right (Colliding)
    PLayer.right > Plat.left (Colliding)
    Last position of Player.top is above Plat.bottom
    Last position of Player.bottom is below Plat.top
    Move Player to last position (Based on vx)
    Set Player.vx to 0
-Floors
    Player.bottom < Plat.top (Colliding)
    Last position of Player.bottom is above Plat.top
    Move Player to last position (Based on vy)
    Set Player.vy to 0
-Ceilings
    Player.top > Plat.bottom (Colliding)
    Last position of Player.top is below Plat.bottom
    Move Player to last position (Based on vy)
    Set Player.vy to 0

make a move command that does take values again

Make collide() return a collision code or Nothing

(Damon) Make on_collision() take both the sprite and the 
    collision code as parameters

Use new collide() and on_collision() to make the Player
follow the above rules when it collides with a platform
