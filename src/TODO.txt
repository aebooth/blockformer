Make it so Level's move_all() method actually calls 
move on all sprites managed by the level. 

Change all the MotionSpecification-using classes 
so that their move method is overridden to use the 
motion from the MotionSpecification so that move_all()
from Level works as intended

Check into callability of collide() on all sprites

Call move()/move_all() and then collide() on all 
sprites 10x per frame. Stop if there is a collision.
Velocities need to be divided by 10. At the end if 
you've made it through all 10 iterations, make the 
sprites move the remaining amount:
    vx - vx // 10 * 10 (for example)
and check collisions one more time

Fix collide() for platform now that we will have incremental
movement.
